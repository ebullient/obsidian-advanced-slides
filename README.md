MatthÃ¤us worked on this plugin for a long time, and [announced that he was discontinuing](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/discontinued-advanced-slides-create-markdown-based-reveal-js-presentations-in-obsidian/28243) the plugin on the forum.

This plugin was a huge undertaking. I'm just picking up where MatthÃ¤us left off.
